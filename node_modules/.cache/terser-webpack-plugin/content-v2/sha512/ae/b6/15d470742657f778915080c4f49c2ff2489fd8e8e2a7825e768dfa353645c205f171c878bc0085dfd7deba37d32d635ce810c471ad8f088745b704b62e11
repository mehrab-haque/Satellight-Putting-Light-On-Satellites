The Hubble telescope is named after astronomer Edwin Hubble.The Hubble telescope was built by the United States space agency NASA with contributions from the European Space Agency.Hubble is the only telescope designed to be maintained in space by astronauts. Five Space Shuttle missions have repaired, upgraded, and replaced systems on the telescope, including all five of the main instruments. The fifth mission was canceled on safety grounds following the Columbia disaster (2003), but NASA administrator Michael D. Griffin approved the fifth servicing mission which was completed in 2009.

However, not all of the uses envisioned in the initial memorandum of understanding between NASA and Roscosmos have come to fruition. In the 2010 United States National Space Policy, the ISS was given additional roles of serving commercial, diplomatic,and educational purposes.The ISS is a third generation modular space station. Modular stations can allow modules to be added to or removed from the existing structure, allowing greater flexibility.Scientific research,monitoring satellite,benifitting earth with satellite are the main targets of ISS.\"},25994:{color:\"#BB00FF\",type:\"Climate research\",launch_date:\"December 18, 1999, 18:57:39 UTC\",mission_duration:\"Elapsed: 20 years, 9 months, 4 days\",launch_mass:\"4,864 kilograms (10,723 lb)\",isGeoStationary:!1,tle_line1:\"1 25994U 99068A   20266.47514468  .00000052  00000-0  21670-4 0  9993\",tle_line2:\"2 25994  98.2050 339.3794 0001426 101.0110 259.1263 14.57111020104443\",name:\"EOS AM-1\",sat_name:\"TERRA\",country_name:\"USA\",country_flag:\"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/countryFlag/america.png\",icon_url:\"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/satIcon/satIcon3.png\",real_images:[\"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/realImages/TERRA_1.jpg\",\"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/realImages/TERRA_2.jpg\"],use_cases:[\"Identifying forest stands and tallying their area to estimate forest supplies (MODIS)\",\"Monitoring air quality in the lower atmosphere (MOPITT)\",\"Fighting wildfires by planning firefighter dispatch (MODIS)\"],description:'Terra (EOS AM-1) is a multi-national NASA scientific research satellite in a Sun-synchronous orbit around the Earth.

The aim is to develop a stable, closed-loop, bio-regenerative life support system functioning in low gravity.In more detail, porous lava stones will be fitted in trickle filters and dried soil containing normal soil microbial colonies. Microbes then use nitrite (NO\\u2212\\n2) to convert the harmful ammonia (NH\\n3) into nitrate (NO\\u2212\\n3), which is then added to six tomato seeds as liquid fertiliser.In addition, the system incorporates a colony of the single-cell microorganism Euglena gracilis, which is a photosynthetic algae able to produce oxygen and biomass while protecting the whole system against high ammonia concentrations. This oxygen is necessary for the conversion of urine to nitrate until the photosynthetic oxygen production by the tomatoes is sufficient\"},44048:{color:\"#00DDFF\",type:\"Communication\",launch_date:\"22 February 2019, 01:45 UTC\",mission_duration:\"15 years (planned)\",launch_mass:\"4100 kg\",isGeoStationary:!0,tle_line1:\"1 44048U 19009A   20270.55716983 -.00000258  00000-0  00000-0 0  9990\",tle_line2:\"2 44048   0.0172 184.6265 0002047 346.6905 181.0820  1.00270132  5809\",name:\"NUSANTARA SATU\",country_name:\"Indonesia\",sat_name:\"PSN VI or PSN-6\",country_flag:\"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/countryFlag/Indonesia.png\",icon_url:\"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/satIcon/satIcon4.png\",real_images:[\"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/realImages/Nusantara_1.jpg\",\"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/realImages/Nasuntara_2.jpg\"],use_cases:[\"The satellite offers a total bandwidth of 15 gigabits per second\",\"Its expected service time is a minimum of 15 years.

The advantages of this combination are that in addition to the classical capability of observation based on the recognition of the geometrical characteristics of the scene, there is the one offered by hyperspectral sensors which can determine the chemical-physical composition of objects present on the scene. This offers the scientific community and users many applications in the field of environmental monitoring, resource management, crop classification, pollution control, etc. Further applications are possible even in the field of National Security.PRISMA is a program completely funded by ASI and is a follow on of HypSEO mission.The satellite was launched on 22 March 2019 aboard a Vega rocket.\"},45026:{color:\"#FF00FF\",type:\"Communication\",launch_date:\"16 January 2020, 21:05 (UTC)\",mission_duration:\"Planned: 15 years Elapsed: 7 months, 30 days\",launch_mass:\"3,357 kg (7,401 lb)\",isGeoStationary:!0,tle_line1:\"1 45026U 20005A   20258.43888708 -.00000174  00000-0  00000+0 0  9999\",tle_line2:\"2 45026   0.0191 152.0658 0003534 304.1600 138.6469  1.00269284  2456\",name:\"GeoStationary Satellite \",sat_name:\"GSAT-30\",country_name:\"INDIA\",country_flag:\"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/countryFlag/India.jpg\",icon_url:\"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/satIcon/satIcon4.png\",real_images:[\"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/realImages/GSAT-30_1.jpg\",\"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/realImages/GSAT-30_2.jpg\",\"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/realImages/GSAT-30_3.jpg\"],use_cases:[\"GSAT-30 provides DTH Television Services, connectivity to VSATs for ATM, stock-exchange, television uplinking and teleport services, Digital Satellite News Gathering (DSNG) and e-governance applications.
