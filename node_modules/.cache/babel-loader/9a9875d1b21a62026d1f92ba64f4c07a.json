The Hubble telescope is named after astronomer Edwin Hubble.The Hubble telescope was built by the United States space agency NASA with contributions from the European Space Agency.Hubble is the only telescope designed to be maintained in space by astronauts. Five Space Shuttle missions have repaired, upgraded, and replaced systems on the telescope, including all five of the main instruments. The fifth mission was canceled on safety grounds following the Columbia disaster (2003), but NASA administrator Michael D. Griffin approved the fifth servicing mission which was completed in 2009. The telescope was still operating as of April 24, 2020, its 30th anniversary and could last until 2030–2040.One successor to the Hubble telescope is the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) which is scheduled to be launched in late 2021.\"\n  },\n  \"25544\": {\n    \"color\": \"#FF0000\",\n    \"type\": \"Scientific research,Exploration,Education and cultural outreach\",\n    \"launch_date\": \"20 November 1998; 21 years ago\",\n    \"mission_duration\": \"It has no fixed duration but every six months three to six crew members join there to monitor the space  \",\n    \"launch_mass\": \"419,725 kg (925,335 lb)\",\n    \"isGeoStationary\": false,\n    \"tle_line1\": \"1 25544U 98067A   20259.60133280  .00000295  00000-0  13495-4 0  9993\",\n    \"tle_line2\": \"2 25544  51.6439 261.0466 0000952 103.4889 359.3413 15.48949242246035\",\n    \"name\": \"International Space Station \",\n    \"sat_name\": \"ISS (ZARYA)\",\n    \"country_name\": \"USA\",\n    \"country_flag\": \"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/countryFlag/america.png\",\n    \"icon_url\": \"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/satIcon/satIcon8.png\",\n    \"real_images\": [\n      \"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/realImages/ISS_1.jpg\",\n      \"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/realImages/ISS_2.jpg\",\n      \"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/realImages/ISS_3.jpg\",\n      \"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/realImages/ISS_4.jpg\"\n    ],\n    \"use_cases\": [\n      \"Commercializing low-Earth orbit\",\n      \"Growing high-quality protein crystals\",\n      \"Supporting water purification efforts worldwide.\",\n      \"Bringing space station ultrasound to the ends of the Earth\",\n      \"Improving eye surgery with space hardware\",\n      \"Providing students opportunities to conduct their own science in space\"\n    ],\n    \"description\": \"The International Space Station (ISS) is a modular space station (habitable artificial satellite) in low Earth orbit.

However, not all of the uses envisioned in the initial memorandum of understanding between NASA and Roscosmos have come to fruition. In the 2010 United States National Space Policy, the ISS was given additional roles of serving commercial, diplomatic,and educational purposes.The ISS is a third generation modular space station.

The first attempt to launch it occurred on 23 June 2010, however the launch was scrubbed due to a problem with one of the rocket's subsystems.A subsequent attempt on 24 June was also scrubbed, due to a problem with the pressurisation of the rocket's fuel tanks.The launch occurred at 21:41 UTC on 26 June 2010.\"\n  },\n  \"37779\": {\n    \"color\": \"#A07335\",\n    \"type\": \"Geosynchronous and Communication\",\n    \"launch_date\": \"11 August 2011, 16:15:04 UTC[2]\",\n    \"mission_duration\": \"12 years\",\n    \"launch_mass\": \"5,115 kilograms (11,277 lb)[1]\",\n    \"isGeoStationary\": true,\n    \"tle_line1\": \"1 37779U 11042A   20261.27410670  .00000140  00000-0  00000+0 0  9993\",\n    \"tle_line2\": \"2 37779   0.0558 308.2868 0003149 166.6548  18.3948  1.00268699 33236\",\n    \"name\": \"Advanced geosynchronous and communications satellite \",\n    \"sat_name\": \"Paksat-1R\",\n    \"country_name\": \"Pakistan\",\n    \"country_flag\": \"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/countryFlag/Pakistan.png\",\n    \"icon_url\": \"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/satIcon/satIcon4.png\",\n    \"real_images\": [\n      \"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/realImages/Paksat-1_1.jpg\",\n      \"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/realImages/Paksat-1_2.jpg\",\n      \"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/realImages/Paksat-1_3.jpg\"\n    ],\n    \"use_cases\": [\n      \"The PakSat-1 offers the C and Ku band coverage in over 75 countries across Europe, Africa, Middle East, South and Central Asia\",\n      \"PAKSAT enables businesses highly cost-effective means to deploy mission critical applications, regardless of the location and remoteness of their offices with applications like Web access, corporate networks and Voice over IP.\",\n      \"PAKSAT enables businesses highly cost-effective means to deploy mission critical applications, regardless of the location and remoteness of their offices with applications like Web access, corporate networks and Voice over IP.\"\n    ],\n    \"description\": \"PakSat-1R (or PakSat-1 Replacement) is an advanced geosynchronous and communications satellite that was manufactured by China Great Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC) and operated by the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco), an executive space authority of the government of Pakistan.[6] The PakSat-1R was developed and built as a geostationary telecommunications satellite and was launched from Xichang, China, at 16:15 UTC on 11 August 2011.

The advantages of this combination are that in addition to the classical capability of observation based on the recognition of the geometrical characteristics of the scene, there is the one offered by hyperspectral sensors which can determine the chemical-physical composition of objects present on the scene. This offers the scientific community and users many applications in the field of environmental monitoring, resource management, crop classification, pollution control, etc. Further applications are possible even in the field of National Security.PRISMA is a program completely funded by ASI and is a follow on of HypSEO mission.The satellite was launched on 22 March 2019 aboard a Vega rocket.\"\n  },\n  \"45026\": {\n    \"color\": \"#FF00FF\",\n    \"type\": \"Communication\",\n    \"launch_date\": \"16 January 2020, 21:05 (UTC)\",\n    \"mission_duration\": \"Planned: 15 years Elapsed: 7 months, 30 days\",\n    \"launch_mass\": \"3,357 kg (7,401 lb)\",\n    \"isGeoStationary\": true,\n    \"tle_line1\": \"1 45026U 20005A   20258.43888708 -.00000174  00000-0  00000+0 0  9999\",\n    \"tle_line2\": \"2 45026   0.0191 152.0658 0003534 304.1600 138.6469  1.00269284  2456\",\n    \"name\": \"GeoStationary Satellite \",\n    \"sat_name\": \"GSAT-30\",\n    \"country_name\": \"INDIA\",\n    \"country_flag\": \"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/countryFlag/India.jpg\",\n    \"icon_url\": \"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/satIcon/satIcon4.png\",\n    \"real_images\": [\n      \"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/realImages/GSAT-30_1.jpg\",\n      \"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/realImages/GSAT-30_2.jpg\",\n      \"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/realImages/GSAT-30_3.jpg\"\n    ],\n    \"use_cases\": [\n      \"GSAT-30 provides DTH Television Services, connectivity to VSATs for ATM, stock-exchange, television uplinking and teleport services, Digital Satellite News Gathering (DSNG) and e-governance applications.
