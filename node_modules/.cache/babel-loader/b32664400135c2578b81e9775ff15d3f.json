It was not the first space telescope, but it is one of the largest and most versatile, well known both as a vital research tool and as a public relations boon for astronomy. The Hubble telescope is named after astronomer Edwin Hubble.The Hubble telescope was built by the United States space agency NASA with contributions from the European Space Agency.Hubble is the only telescope designed to be maintained in space by astronauts. Five Space Shuttle missions have repaired, upgraded, and replaced systems on the telescope, including all five of the main instruments. The fifth mission was canceled on safety grounds following the Columbia disaster (2003), but NASA administrator Michael D. Griffin approved the fifth servicing mission which was completed in 2009. The telescope was still operating as of April 24, 2020, its 30th anniversary and could last until 2030–2040.One successor to the Hubble telescope is the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) which is scheduled to be launched in late 2021.\"},\"25544\":{\"color\":\"#FF0000\",\"type\":\"Scientific research,Exploration,Education and cultural outreach\",\"launch_date\":\"20 November 1998; 21 years ago\",\"mission_duration\":\"It has no fixed duration but every six months three to six crew members join there to monitor the space  \",\"launch_mass\":\"419,725 kg (925,335 lb)\",\"isGeoStationary\":false,\"tle_line1\":\"1 25544U 98067A   20259.60133280  .00000295  00000-0  13495-4 0  9993\",\"tle_line2\":\"2 25544  51.6439 261.0466 0000952 103.4889 359.3413 15.48949242246035\",\"name\":\"International Space Station \",\"sat_name\":\"ISS (ZARYA)\",\"country_name\":\"USA\",\"country_flag\":\"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/countryFlag/america.png\",\"icon_url\":\"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/satIcon/satIcon8.png\",\"real_images\":[\"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/realImages/ISS_1.jpg\",\"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/realImages/ISS_2.jpg\",\"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/realImages/ISS_3.jpg\",\"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/realImages/ISS_4.jpg\"],\"use_cases\":[\"Commercializing low-Earth orbit\",\"Growing high-quality protein crystals\",\"Supporting water purification efforts worldwide.\",\"Bringing space station ultrasound to the ends of the Earth\",\"Improving eye surgery with space hardware\",\"Providing students opportunities to conduct their own science in space\"],\"description\":\"The International Space Station (ISS) is a modular space station (habitable artificial satellite) in low Earth orbit. It is a multinational collaborative project between five participating space agencies: NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia), JAXA (Japan), ESA (Europe), and CSA (Canada).The station is divided into two sections: the Russian Orbital Segment (ROS), operated by Russia; and the United States Orbital Segment (USOS), which is shared by many nations.The ISS was originally intended to be a laboratory, observatory, and factory while providing transportation, maintenance, and a low Earth orbit staging base for possible future missions to the Moon, Mars, and asteroids. However, not all of the uses envisioned in the initial memorandum of understanding between NASA and Roscosmos have come to fruition. In the 2010 United States National Space Policy, the ISS was given additional roles of serving commercial, diplomatic,and educational purposes.The ISS is a third generation modular space station.

Its very innovative instrumentation is unprecedentedly light (100 kg) and the most compact ever operational for high-energy astrophysics (approximately a cube of about 60 cm size) with excellent detection and imaging capability. Satellite data are collected by the ASI ground station in Malindi (Kenya), then quickly transferred to the Satellite Operations Centre in Fucino, transferred, preprocessed, and stored and analyzed at the ASI Science Data Center (ASDC) in Frascati. In parallel the pre-processed data are transferred at INAF/OAS Bologna for a fast science alert generation, thus assuring a very rapid response to gamma-ray detections, obtained by special quick look analysis programs and coordinated ground-based and space observations.AGILE was successfully launched on 23 April 2007, from the Indian base of Sriharikota and was inserted in an equatorial orbit with low particle background. On 23 April 2007, ASI made contact with AGILE; its signals were acquired by the ground station at the Broglio Space Centre near Malindi, Kenya and it was placed in a Sun-pointing mode.\"},\"33051\":{\"color\":\"#00DDAA\",\"type\":\"Communication\",\"launch_date\":\"9 June 2008, 12:15 UTC\",\"mission_duration\":\"15 years\",\"launch_mass\":\"4,500 kilograms (9,900 lb)\",\"isGeoStationary\":true,\"tle_line1\":\"1 33051U 08028A   20270.42842598 -.00000271  00000-0  00000-0 0  9994\",\"tle_line2\":\"2 33051   0.0135 181.5164 0003797   5.3187  65.3015  1.00271500 45082\",\"name\":\"CHINASAT 9\",\"country_name\":\"China\",\"sat_name\":\"CHINASAT 9 (ZX 9)\",\"country_flag\":\"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/countryFlag/China.png\",\"icon_url\":\"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/satIcon/satIcon5.png\",\"real_images\":[\"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/realImages/ChinaSat_9_1.jpg\",\"https://satellitedatanasa.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/realImages/ChinaSat_9_2.jpg\"],\"use_cases\":[\"It will  broadcast satellite services (BSS), including eighteen 36 MHz and four 54 MHz channels.\"],\"description\":\"ChinaSat 9 (Chinese: 中星9号; pinyin: Zhōngxīng Jiǔhào),also known as ZX-9,[citation needed] is a Chinese communications satellite.
